# The Force - Particle interaction viewer
The Force is a Game Maker Studio 2 "game" to view particle interactions between puntual particles with custom mass and charge in a 2D plane.

**This is a work in progress.**

# To do
 - Complete this readme (in depth explanation, how to use).
 - Add magnetic interaction (this one is going to take a long time).
